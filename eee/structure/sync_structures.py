    """
    Take a set of structures, clean up, align, and figure out which sites are
    shared among all structures. Output is a directory with pdb files and a
    report describing structures. The residue numbers are replaced with their 
    sites in the alignment (meaning residue numbers compare between structures).
    The b-factor column of each pdb file has the fraction of structures in which
    that specific site is seen. The occupancy column is 1 if the amino acids are
    same at the site for all structures, 0 if the amino acids are different. 
    (Note: at sites with a mix of Cys and Ser across structures, the Ser 
    residues are mutated to Cys). HETATM entries will always have 0 occupancy
    and b-factors.

    ----------

        list of structure files to use for the calculation. These files should 
        be in RCSB cif (preferred) or pdb format.
