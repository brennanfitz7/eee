    Extract an alignment from a simulation done on an evolutionary tree.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    calc_dir : str
        directory holding the calculation
    include_ancestors : bool, default=False
        whether or not to include ancestors in the alignment output. If True,
        ancestors are given numbered names of the form anc{counter}. The 
        ancestral nodes in the tree are given node.name values with the 
        appropriate name. 
    
    Returns
    -------
    out : dict
        dictionary where keys are node names and values are sequences (as str)
    tree : ete3.Tree
        tree object used for the inference. If include_ancestors = True, this 
        will have added ancestor names.
