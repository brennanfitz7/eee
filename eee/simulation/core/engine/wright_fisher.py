    Run a Wright-Fisher simulation. This is a relatively low-level function. 
    Most users should probably call this via other simulation functions like
    simulate_evolution and simulate_tree. 
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    gc : GenotypeContainer
        container holding genotypes with either a wildtype sequence or a 
        sequences from a previous evolutionary simulation. This will bring in 
        everything we need to calculate fitness of each genotype. 
    population : dict, list-like, or int
        population for the simulation. Can be a dictionary of populations where
        keys are genotypes and values are populations. Can be an array where the
        length is the total population size and the values are the genotypes. 
        {5:2,4:1,0:2} is equivalent to [5,5,4,0,0]. If an integer, interpret as
        the population size. Create an initial population consisting of all 
        wildtype.
    mutation_rate : float
        Lambda for poisson distribution to select the number of genotypes to 
        mutate at each generation. Should be >= 0. 
    num_generations : int
        number of generations to run the simulation. Should be >= 1. If 
        num_mutations is specified, this is the *maximum* number of generations 
        allowed. 
    num_mutations : int, optional
        stop the simulation after the most frequent genotype has num_mutations 
        mutations. Should be >= 1. If specified, the simulation will run until
        either num_mutations is reached OR the simulation hits num_generations.
    disable_status_bar : bool, default=False
        turn off the tqdm status bar for the calculation 
    write_prefix : str, optional
        write output files during the run with this prefix. If not specified, 
        do not write files. If specified, gc and generations will be returned
        *empty* as their contents will have been written to lower memory 
        consumption.
    write_frequency : int, default=1000
        write the generations out every write_frequency generations. 
    rng : numpy.random._generator.Generator, optional
        random number generator object to allow reproducible sims. If None, one
        is created locally. 

    Returns
    -------
    gc : GenotypeContainer
        updated GenotypeContainer holding all new genotypes that appeared over 
        the simulation
    generations : list
        list of dicts where each entry in the list is a generation. each dict
        holds the population at that generation with keys as genotypes and 
        values as populations.
